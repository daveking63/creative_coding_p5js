<h1>Exercise 1: Create Abstract Logo</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>

Find an abstract logo that you like and draw it in P5.js. Sharpen your visual senses, make the first steps in Processing, and put your programming muscle memory to work.

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

Use p5.js to produce an abstract logo ('that you like'). In this case I've produced the two logos used as examples in the exercise. That is, the 'Instagram' logo and the 'Sony Vaio' logo. In the first case, the logo is created and displayed in steps. With the second logo, only the final version is produced. In both cases a description of the structure and processes used to created the logo is provided at the top of the code listings.
