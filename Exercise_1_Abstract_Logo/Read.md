<h1>Exercise 1: Create Abstract Logo</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>

Find an abstract logo that you like and draw it in P5.js. Sharpen your visual senses, make the first steps in Processing, and put your programming muscle memory to work.

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<ol>
<li>Utilize p5.js to produce an existing abstract logo</li>
<li>Employ p5.js to create your own abstract logo</li>
</ol>

In this case, I'm first using the two logo's discussed in the project materials: Instagram and Vaio.
