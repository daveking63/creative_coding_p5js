The objective of this exercise was to utilize the sketch from the previous exercise, drawing an abstract artwork, in order to animate the art piece either in 2D or 3D.

The sketch in this exercise is based on the first sketch of Julian Stanczak 'Constellation in Red' provided in the file 'exercise_2_contemporary_visual_art' in this repository. As noted before, Stanczak was one of the founders and leaders of the Op Art movement. A discussion of the original painting is provided at:

A reproduction of the official version (a .png file) is provided in this sub-directory.

It is easy to see from the official version that the painting consists of a series of 36 tiles. The coloration of each square is a gradation of either of 3 colors -- usually emanating from the center. In the earlier version the colors of the tiles were static. In this instance the tiles can be 'toggled' to flash between two color schemes where the gradation of the first and third colors are reversed.  Additionally, the speed of the flash can be controlled. The following provides a summary of the current factors that can be modified:

<ol>
<li>Toggle the flashing color schemes -- typing 't' or 'T' toggles the flashing on or off</li>
<li>Grid lines -- typing 'g' or 'G' turns grid lines on or off</li>
<li>Frame Rate of the 'drawing' cycle - typing a number between 1-9 changes the rate from 5 to 45 in increments of 5 (5 is the default)</li>
</ol>
