A reproduction of the original is again provided in a .png file in this sub-directory, although this time it shows the individual tiles with borders.A different rendition ('Constellation in Green') can be found at: 

From the original version it is easy to see that painting consists of a series of 36 tiles. The coloration of each square is a gradation of either of 3 colors -- usually emanating from the center. In the earlier version the colors of the tiles were static. In this instance the tiles can be 'toggled' to flash between two color schemes where the gradation of the first and third colors are reversed.  Additionally, the speed of the flash can be controlled. The following provides a summary of the current factors that can be modified:

<ol>
<li>Toggle the flashing color schemes -- typing 't' or 'T' toggles the flashing on or off</li>
<li>Grid lines -- typing 'g' or 'G' turns grid lines on or off</li>
<li>Frame Rate of the 'drawing' cycle - typing a number between 1-9 changes the rate from 5 to 45 in increments of 5 (5 is the default)</li>
</ol>
