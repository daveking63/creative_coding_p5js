Exercise 4. Photos in Interaction

Goal: Find a photo you like and use animation and interactin in P5.js to bring to life.

In this instance, I have a series of photos (substituted from one run to the next) that I used to:

<ol>
<li> Pointillize the pixels in the photo image, substituting ellipses for the points in a random fashion;</li><br>
<li> Select various points based on their HSL values to redraw from one frame to the next. In this instance I've tried to select pixels that aren't  gray, white or black. These values can be selected to choose other color combinations. It's the redrawing of these pixels that provides a sense of motion.</li>
</ol>

The code for this exercise is contained in the file:

  sketch_Pointillist_Motion.js 

along with potential photos that can be used to explore the code.  

Additionally a version of the code and the images are found in an openprocessing sketch:
