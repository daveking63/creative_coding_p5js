#Exercise 1 - Abstract Logo Art#

**Overall Objective**

Find an abstract logo that you like and draw it in P5.js. Sharpen your visual senses, make the first steps in Processing, and put your programming muscle memory to work.

**Interim Deliverables**

Utilize detailed logo development processes to create a p5.js version of an existing logo. In this case I'm utilizing the Instagram and Vaio logos discusses in project materials.

**End Deliverable**

For this milestone, your deliverable will be a .png or other image file of the example image (or use your own) to show the layers using Processing. Share your code as well.
