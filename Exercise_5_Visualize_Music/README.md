Objective:Find a piece of music you like and create a music video with P5.js using elements of the previous stage.

Result: This exercise is still in process. As a first attempt, I've created a sketch that animates fireworks. There are 3 sounds - whistle, swoosh, and boom - that are synchronized with the random appearance of a firework. Some fireworks have no sound associated the flight from the bottom to the top of their flight, some make a swoosh sound (these are displayed as elongated ellipses), and some whistle (denoted by a very thin, elongated ellipse). At the top of the flight of a particular firework, the firework explodes (denoted by a boom sound) and a series of particles fall from that point toward the ground.

The current animation consists of the code --  sketch-fireworks_show -- along with the background image and the 3 mp3 sound files. A running version can also be found at:

There are a series of adjustments that need to be made with this animation and background music needs to be added (i.e. the 1812 Overature).
